 ### Platform/Working OS
 - This python script is cross-platform and has been tested on macOS and Windows.
 
 ### Usage
 Folder Cleaner (for Python) usage is very simple.
 
 - Open the file (with Python) and you will be prompted to enter the path of the folder you want to review (tips: you can also simply drag and drop the folder into the terminal).
 - Type the desired organizing mode and press `enter` to continue.
 - The program will do everything else automatically!
 
 ### Available organizing mode
- `nosort` > nothing will be sorted in the cleaned up folder.
